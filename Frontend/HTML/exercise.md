using just HTML / CSS (and bootstrap) create a photo gallery website. 
This can take any form, with any methods of grabbing / saving images. Make sure there is a variety of shape, size and composition of photos.

Must include: 
- Header 
- Nav bar (no need to make other pages, just a fake nav)
- Catelogue of various photos, however you wish to display
- Some text blocks dotted here and there
