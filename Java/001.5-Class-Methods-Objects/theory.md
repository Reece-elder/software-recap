# Classes 

Classes are blueprints to create objects
They include all of the attributes and methods an object could be able to do

# Objects 

Objects are 'Physical' versions of classes, they take the traits and attributes and able 'to do stuff'

# Methods

Methods are what the objects can do, not just what make up the object. 

Class   = Mould for creating a car
Object  = The car itself
Method  = What can the car do (drive, brake etc.)

# Attributes

Attributes are the 'properties' of an object, in real life this would be colour, weight, seats etc. 

Classes don't HAVE attributes but can have references for them, for objects to use. 


The mould of a car side doesnt have 'Windows' but it has imprints of them to allow the Object to have windows. It has a reference to them
