# Polymorphism

Objects can take on multiple (poly) forms (morph), such as when a parent class reference is used for a child class object. 

Simply put, what 'fields' does an object belong to, as all objects are children of something

## Shark example



public static void main(String[] args){
    Shark bruce = new Shark();
}

Shark is a Shark (from the shark class)
Shark is a Fish (From the fish implementation)
Shark is a Object (Every class inherits the Object class)

Shark can use traits from all of these
