# Inheritance

Classes can acquire all non-private properties of another class if it is `extending` the original class. 
Attributes (Strings, ints etc.) and methods (public String doThing()) can be inherited

Useful for when an object is based off of something, but needs more specific properties

## Hiding Methods

Static methods can be hidden with a subclass by declaring a method with the same name/signature
