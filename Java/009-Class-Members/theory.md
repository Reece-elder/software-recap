# Class members 

Class members are either variables or methods within a class. 
Class members can be instanced or static and final

## Instance class members

Instance members = attributes or methods which need an instance (object) created before and are unique to that instance.

Class   = Cake Mould
Object  = Cake

An instance member of the Cake would be flavour, each cakes flavour is unique AND the mould has no flavour.

Instance attributes DO not have Static
